CRUD app with react on frontend, and node on backend. Making use of features such as Context API, reducers, sequelize ORM and an Express server.

## Where to start?
The steps are the same for both backend and frontend:  
1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager;  
2. Copy .env.example and rename it to .env on root folder. You'll need to fill db username and password, feel free to change other variables as you will aswell. Oh, app will automatically create tables, but won't create database, you'll need to have it setup already;
3. Fire up the start script with you preferred manager, like "yarn start" or "npm start".  

Done, you're all set.

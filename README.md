Create an account (or not) and leave a message on the board, speak with all your heart.  
This is a fullstack message board app, made using React on the front and Node JS on the backend, and putting to use technologies like: JWT auth, Sequelize, Express.

## Where to start?

The steps are the same to build both backend and frontend:

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager;
2. Copy .env.example and rename it to .env on root folder. Fill in the necessary variables like database username and password and a JWT secret. Feel free to change other variables aswell. Oh, app will automatically create tables, but won't create database, you'll need to have it setup already;
3. Fire up the start script with you preferred manager, like "yarn start" or "npm start".

Done, you're all set.
